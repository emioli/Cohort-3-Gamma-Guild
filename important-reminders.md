# **Important Reminders**

⚠️ **Replace "your-name"** with your actual name in ALL file names and folder paths

⚠️ **Write in your OWN words** - Do not copy-paste from sources. Plagiarism will result in zero grade.

⚠️ **Submit BEFORE 5:00 PM Friday** - No exceptions without prior approval

⚠️ **Include your tweet link** in your markdown file

⚠️ **Test your GitHub push** - Make sure everything uploaded correctly

⚠️ **Ask questions EARLY** - Don't wait until Thursday night if you're stuck
